# Virtual Etch-a-Sketch
## User Story
As a user, I want the ability to create a custom grid to draw on as I see fit.

### Start Sketching

#### Overview
Hovering over the grid squares will change its color, allowing the user to draw whatever they seem fit. The grid dimensions are customizable and users can freely toggle between 6 different themes.

This app is usable on both desktop on mobile but as of now, users are unable to drag and "paint" when on their phone. .
